3. **Progressive Enhancement**
   - Foundation built first (Phase 1)
   - Features added incrementally
   - Each phase builds on previous work

### Quality Assurance Methods

1. **Automated Validation**
   - Syntax checking and linting
   - Test execution and validation
   - Code structure verification

2. **Manual Verification**
   - Chrome extension loading tests
   - UI/UX validation
   - Cross-browser compatibility checks

## Best Practices for AI-Assisted Development

- Provide detailed PRD with specific requirements
- Define acceptance criteria upfront
- Establish quality metrics and success criteria

### 2. Iterative Development
- Break large projects into manageable phases
- Validate each component before proceeding
- Maintain continuous testing throughout

### 3. Comprehensive Documentation
- Document architecture decisions
- Maintain clear code comments
- Create user-facing documentation

### 4. Quality Gates
- Establish testing requirements (85%+ coverage)
- Define acceptance criteria for each task
