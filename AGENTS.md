**Project**: Trail Mix Chrome Extension  
**AI Assistant**: Claude (Anthropic)  
**Development Model**: Human-AI Collaborative Programming  
**Status**: Phase 1 Complete, Ready for Phase 2

## Repository Analysis (Codex CLI)

This section documents the current Trail Mix codebase structure, behavior, and practical next steps.

### Architecture
- **Manifest V3**: `manifest.json` wires a background service worker, a content script for `*.bandcamp.com/*`, and a side panel UI (MV3 `side_panel`).
- **Three tiers**:
  - `background/`: lifecycle orchestration, queue-based download coordination, authentication checks, purchase discovery, filename routing.
  - `content/`: page scraping, in-page, cookie-attached network requests, and readiness checks for download pages.
  - `sidepanel/`: UI for auth state, discovery, controls, progress, and logs.
- **Core libraries**: `lib/utils.js` (logging, errors, async, path, validation), `lib/auth-manager.js` (cookie + API-based auth), `lib/download-queue.js`, `lib/download-job.js`, and `lib/download-manager.js` (implemented core engine). `lib/metadata-handler.js` remains minimal for future embedding.

### Key Components
- `background/service-worker.js`
  - Initializes defaults and sets side panel behavior on install/update.
  - Message router: `GET_EXTENSION_STATUS`, `CHECK_AUTHENTICATION`, `DISCOVER_PURCHASES`, `DISCOVER_AND_START`, `START_DOWNLOAD`, `PAUSE_DOWNLOAD`, `STOP_DOWNLOAD`, `DOWNLOAD_ALBUM`, `DOWNLOAD_SINGLE`.
  - Discovery flow: ensures a Bandcamp tab → asks content script to navigate to purchases → scrapes purchases → enqueues jobs in `DownloadQueue`.
  - Download flow: sequential queue processing via `DownloadManager` (one active job at a time). Resolves `downloadUrl` with `GET_DOWNLOAD_LINK` content-message when missing; validates `bcbits.com` CDN URLs before starting; broadcasts progress via `DOWNLOAD_PROGRESS` and logs via `LOG_MESSAGE`.
  - Filename routing: `chrome.downloads.onDeterminingFilename` writes under `TrailMix/<Artist>/<Title>/<original>`, using metadata passed via a shared `downloadMetadata` map.
- `content/bandcamp-scraper.js`
  - Handlers: `NAVIGATE_TO_PURCHASES`, `SCRAPE_PURCHASES`, `GET_DOWNLOAD_LINK`, `CHECK_AUTH_STATUS`, `MONITOR_DOWNLOAD_PAGE`, `CHECK_DOWNLOAD_READY`, and `makeAuthenticatedRequest` (fetch with `credentials: 'include'`).
  - Scraping: prefers JSON `#pagedata` blob on purchases pages; otherwise uses resilient DOM queries on collection pages. Extracts title, artist, url, artwork, type, and optional `downloadUrl`.
  - Utilities: `DOMUtils` with `waitForElement`, safe text/attribute access.
- `sidepanel/` (HTML/CSS/JS)
  - Initializes UI, loads settings, checks auth, triggers discovery + downloads, and renders `DOWNLOAD_PROGRESS` and `LOG_MESSAGE` updates. Re-checks auth on visibility and Bandcamp tab loads.
- `lib/utils.js`
  - `Logger`, `ErrorHandler`, `StringUtils`, `PathUtils`, `AsyncUtils`, `ValidationUtils` — exported for browser/SW and Node.
- `lib/auth-manager.js`
  - Caches auth state; checks Bandcamp cookies; validates via an authenticated content-script request to `https://bandcamp.com/api/fan/2/collection_summary`. Exports class + singleton. Not yet wired into the SW’s `CHECK_AUTHENTICATION`.
- `lib/download-queue.js` / `lib/download-job.js`
  - Priority queue with pause/resume; job lifecycle with retry policy and progress tracking.
- `lib/download-manager.js`
  - Core engine: opens inactive tab to download page, polls content for readiness, validates `bcbits.com` CDN URL, starts Chrome download, tracks progress via `chrome.downloads.onChanged`, and closes tab.

### Data & Message Flow
- Side Panel → Background: `GET_EXTENSION_STATUS`, `CHECK_AUTHENTICATION`, `DISCOVER_PURCHASES`, `DISCOVER_AND_START`, `START_DOWNLOAD`, `PAUSE_DOWNLOAD`, `STOP_DOWNLOAD`.
- Background → Content: `NAVIGATE_TO_PURCHASES`, `SCRAPE_PURCHASES`, `GET_DOWNLOAD_LINK`, `MONITOR_DOWNLOAD_PAGE`, `CHECK_DOWNLOAD_READY`.
- Background → Side Panel: `DOWNLOAD_PROGRESS`, `DOWNLOAD_PROGRESS_SINGLE`, and `LOG_MESSAGE`.

### Permissions & Security
- Permissions: `downloads`, `cookies`, `activeTab`, `storage`, `scripting`, `tabs`, `sidePanel`; host permissions for Bandcamp only.
- CSP: restricted on extension pages. Background avoids direct fetch; proxies via content script for cookie-attached requests.
- Download URL validation: `DownloadManager` restricts downloads to `https://*.bcbits.com/`.

### Testing & Tooling
- Jest + JSDOM with thresholds (85% lines/branches/functions/statements) configured in `jest.config.js`.
- Chrome APIs mocked in `tests/setup.js` and `tests/mocks/chrome-mock.js`.
- Unit coverage for manifest, project structure, side panel, content script, service worker, utils, download queue/manager, and auth manager.
- `npm test` plus scoped scripts. Build/dev scripts are placeholders pending bundling needs.
- Note: `jest.config.js` still includes `collectCoverageFrom: 'popup/**/*.js'`; update to include `sidepanel/**/*.js` for accurate coverage.

### Notable Design Choices
- Robust scraping: JSON blob first, then multiple selector fallbacks; works for purchases and collection pages.
- Queue-first downloads: sequential processing with `DownloadManager` (one active job). `maxConcurrentDownloads` is stored but not yet used for true parallelism.
- Dual auth logic: service worker performs cookie inspection; `lib/auth-manager.js` provides a richer, content-proxied validation path — candidates for consolidation.
- Filename routing centralization via `onDeterminingFilename` to ensure consistent subfolder structure.

### Gaps & Recommendations
- **Auth unification**: Route `CHECK_AUTHENTICATION` through `lib/auth-manager.js` for a single source of truth; background can delegate its enhanced cookie analysis to the manager.
- **Selector validity**: Replace unsupported CSS selectors (e.g., `:contains`) referenced in comments or fallbacks with valid patterns and/or text filtering.
- **Concurrency**: Consider multiple `DownloadManager` instances to honor `maxConcurrentDownloads` while preserving determinism and UI clarity.
- **Coverage config**: Replace `popup/**` with `sidepanel/**` in Jest config to reflect current UI location.
- **Metadata embedding**: Extend `lib/metadata-handler.js` for ID3/artwork embedding and safe filenames (Phase 5).
- **Build pipeline**: Wire Babel/ESLint and optionally Vite/Rollup for packaging; keep CSP and MV3 constraints in mind.
- **UX refinements**: Expose concurrency in UI, add clearer in-progress and error states, and surface discovered purchase counts upfront.

## Agent Playbook (Codex/Claude)

Use this section when extending or fixing the codebase with an AI agent.

- **MV3 constraints**: No DOM or cookie-attached fetch in the service worker. Route network calls requiring cookies via content script (`makeAuthenticatedRequest`).
- **Message contracts**: When adding a feature, define a single source of truth for message names and payload shapes across `sidepanel → background → content`. Update tests in `tests/unit/*` accordingly.
- **Auth checks**: Prefer `lib/auth-manager.js` to validate sessions. Refactor `CHECK_AUTHENTICATION` in the SW to call the manager and surface `userInfo` (fanId, collectionCount).
- **Discovery flow**: Keep navigation and scraping in the content script. Avoid brittle selectors; prefer parsing the `#pagedata` JSON when present.
- **Downloads pipeline**: Resolve `downloadUrl` via content; validate `bcbits.com` URLs; pipe metadata to `onDeterminingFilename` via `downloadMetadata` so files land under `TrailMix/<Artist>/<Title>/...`.
- **Queue semantics**: Use `DownloadQueue` and `DownloadJob` for retries/backoff. Maintain one active job unless implementing parallelism; if adding concurrency, ensure progress UX remains clear.
- **Testing**: Add/adjust unit tests under `tests/unit/` for new handlers and flows. Update `jest.config.js` to include `sidepanel/**` in coverage if you touch UI.
- **Style and scope**: Keep changes minimal and targeted. Don’t fetch directly from the SW; don’t alter unrelated tests or build steps.

### Common Tasks

- **Add a new background message**:
  - Update SW switch in `onMessage` and implement handler.
  - Add corresponding side panel action and (if needed) content handler.
  - Write/adjust tests in `tests/unit/service-worker.test.js` and `tests/unit/sidepanel.test.js`.

- **Adjust scraping**:
  - Tweak `content/bandcamp-scraper.js` fallback selectors; avoid unsupported selectors; prefer text filtering.
  - Add tests in `tests/unit/dom-scrape.test.js` and `tests/unit/content-script.test.js`.

- **Change download pathing**:
  - Modify `onDeterminingFilename` logic in SW; keep `TrailMix/Artist/Title` shape and sanitize filenames.
  - Ensure `DownloadManager` still supplies metadata; extend `metadata-handler.js` if embedding.

- **Wire up auth unification**:
  - Replace SW cookie-only logic in `handleCheckAuthentication` with calls to `authManager.getAuthStatus()`; fall back gracefully if no Bandcamp tab exists.
  - Update side panel to surface richer `userInfo`.
