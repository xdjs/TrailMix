- [x] **AC2.4**: Handles authentication errors gracefully (cookie API failures, network errors, validation errors)

#### Tasks 2.2-2.6: DEFERRED TO LATER VERSION
**Rationale**: Basic authentication is working (login button opens Bandcamp login page).
Advanced features like in-extension login forms, session monitoring, and state management
will be implemented after core download functionality is proven.

**What's Working Now**:
- ✅ Cookie-based session detection
- ✅ Login button that opens Bandcamp login

- [x] Implement progress tracking:
  - [x] Real-time progress broadcasting to popup
  - [x] Track completed, failed, and active counts
  - [x] Display active download count in UI

#### Task 3.6: View-All Loading (Pagination)

- [x] Goal: When the purchases page shows a total (e.g., “N of M purchases”) and a “View All” button, expand the list and scrape exactly M items. DOM-only (no `#pagedata`). Count includes all purchased items (albums, tracks, mixed media); `visibleCount` counts direct item children only.

- [x] DOM targets and wording:
  - [x] Use `#oh-container`-based selectors as primary. Add fallbacks later if Bandcamp changes DOM.
  - [x] English-only for initial release. Match “View all … purchases” copy; no i18n variations yet.

- [x] Baseline readiness and visible count:
  - [x] Wait up to 5s for the list: canonical `#oh-container > div.purchases > ol`, then fallback `#oh-container div.purchases > ol`.
  - [x] Compute `visibleCount` strictly as `#oh-container > div.purchases > ol > div` (direct children only; no other fallbacks).
  - [x] Parse `expectedTotal` (M) from the summary `#oh-container > div:nth-child(2) > span` (digits-only). Log `expectedTotal` when determined and baseline `visibleCount`.

- [x] Decide whether to expand:
  - [x] If `expectedTotal` exists, `visibleCount < expectedTotal`, and a button exists at `#oh-container > div.purchases > div > button` (or English label match) → attempt expansion.
  - [x] Button label pattern: case-insensitive `/\bview\s+all\b.*\bpurchases\b/` and should contain a total number (digits-only extraction).
  - [x] Otherwise skip expansion and proceed to scraping.
  - [x] Log whether a View All button was detected.

- [x] Perform expansion and monitor completion:
  - [x] Click the detected button once (guard re-entrancy). Log when clicked.
  - [x] Extract digits from the button label as `buttonTotal`; compare to `expectedTotal`. If both present and differ, proceed using `expectedTotal` and log both.
  - [x] Use a MutationObserver on the purchases container to detect growth; polling every `pollMs` only as fallback. Early-stop when `visibleCount >= expectedTotal`.
  - [x] If the button disappears after click (expected), do not attempt a second click. Only re-click if the button still exists and is visible after `retryWindowMs`.
  - [x] Auto-scroll implemented: force page and containers to bottom (window.scrollTo + container scrollIntoView) until `visibleCount >= expectedTotal` or timeout.
  - [x] Enforce `overallTimeoutMs` (capped at 30s). On timeout with known totals, proceed with partial results; with unknown totals, bail per edge-case rules.

- [x] Outcomes and edge cases:
  - [x] Success: record `{ before, after, durationMs }` and proceed.
  - [x] No totals and growth stalls below a small minimum (threshold: <10 items): bail early with warning rather than waiting full timeout. Log the threshold trigger.
  - [x] Timeout with known totals: proceed with partial results, log timeout. Silent in UI for initial release (console-only).
  - [x] No View All button: assume everything visible and continue.
  - [x] After expansion attempt, if DOM scraping yields unexpectedly low results or structural errors, log the error and stop processing.

- [x] Scraping order:
  - [x] Always use DOM scraping; skip `#pagedata` entirely.

- [x] Helper metadata vs public response:
  - [x] The expansion helper may return internal metadata `{ expectedTotal, buttonTotal, found, expanded, complete, durationMs }` for diagnostics.
  - [x] The public `SCRAPE_PURCHASES` response remains `{ success, purchases, totalCount }` (no meta surfaced).

- [x] Response logging:
  - [x] Console logs only (content script): expectedTotal detection, View All detection, buttonTotal, click event, visible vs expected changes (throttled), timeouts/threshold triggers, final outcome.

- [x] Configuration/tunables (defaults, with 30s hard upper bound):
  - [x] `pollMs`: 300ms (fallback only; MutationObserver preferred)
  - [x] `stableWindowMs`: 1500ms
  - [x] `retryWindowMs`: 2000ms (only re-click if button still present)
  - [x] `overallTimeoutMs`: 30000ms cap during expansion
  - [x] `strictMode`: deferred for now (off by default). Toggling deferred.

- [x] Integration and scope:
  - [x] Implement expansion logic in a separate function invoked from the `SCRAPE_PURCHASES` handler.
  - [x] Helper signature: `expandPurchasesIfNeeded(opts) -> { expectedTotal, buttonTotal, found, expanded, complete, durationMs }`.
  - [x] Tunables live as script constants; allow handler to pass optional overrides via `opts`.
  - [x] Service worker activates the Bandcamp tab during discovery to prevent background throttling.

- [ ] Testing (initial scope):
  - [ ] Unit: total parsing (selector + digits-only), English label pattern detection, mismatch handling, growth/early-stop logic, timeout and threshold handling.
  - [ ] Integration tests and i18n coverage deferred for now.

- [x] Acceptance Criteria:
  - [x] AC3.6.1: When total M is present and View All exists, process stops at `found == expectedTotal` or times out; on timeout, partial results are returned with logs only.
  - [x] AC3.6.2: If total is present and `visibleCount >= expectedTotal` initially, expansion is skipped.
  - [x] AC3.6.3: After expansion, DOM-based discovery equals M when not timed out.
  - [x] AC3.6.4: Internal helper returns metadata; public response remains `{ success, purchases, totalCount }`. Required logs are emitted.
  - [x] AC3.6.5: Supports 100s of purchases without activating the tab.

#### Task 3.7: Download Completion Handling ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Monitor download tabs:
  - [x] Check for completion indicators every 2 seconds
  - [x] Detect download_complete, thank-you, or .zip URLs
  - [x] 2-minute timeout for stuck downloads
- [x] Handle tab lifecycle:
  - [x] Auto-close tabs after download starts
  - [x] Clean up tracking data on completion
  - [x] Start next download from queue
- [x] Error handling:
  - [x] Track failed downloads separately
  - [x] Continue processing queue on failures
  - [x] Log detailed error information

**Manual Testing Instructions for Phase 3:**

1. **Setup:**
   - Load extension in Chrome developer mode
   - Log in to Bandcamp with an account that has purchases
   - Open the extension popup

2. **Test Purchase Discovery:**
   - Click "Start Download" button
   - Verify extension navigates to `https://bandcamp.com/{username}/purchases`
   - Check console for "Found X purchases" message
   - Verify popup shows list of first 3 purchases

3. **Test Parallel Downloads:**
   - After discovery completes, watch for multiple tabs opening (up to 3)
   - Each tab should navigate to a download page
   - Verify tabs auto-close after download starts
   - Check progress bar shows "X of Y albums (Z active)"

4. **Test Download Page Handling:**
   - Watch for "Preparing download..." pages
   - Verify extension auto-clicks download button when ready
   - Check that actual file downloads start in Chrome

5. **Test Completion:**
   - Wait for all downloads to complete
   - Verify final message shows completed and failed counts
   - Check Chrome's download folder for .zip files

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Purchases discovered successfully
- ✅ Multiple downloads run in parallel (max 3 tabs)
- ✅ "Preparing" state handled automatically
- ✅ Progress updates shown in real-time
- ✅ Files downloaded to Chrome's default download folder
- [ ] Test download link validation functions

**Acceptance Test:**
- [ ] **AC3.6.1**: Clicks "View All" and loads full purchases list
- [ ] **AC3.6.2**: Works with collections of 100+ albums
- [ ] **AC3.7.1**: Successfully extracts all albums from purchases page
- [ ] **AC3.7.2**: Correctly identifies album metadata (title, artist, date)
- [ ] **AC3.7.3**: Finds valid download links for all purchased albums
- [ ] **AC3.7.4**: Handles edge cases (special characters, missing data)
- [ ] **AC3.7.5**: Works with different Bandcamp page layouts
- [ ] **AC3.7.6**: Scraping completes within reasonable time limits

#### Task 3.10: Refactor Purchases Scraping (DOM-only, Known Selectors)

- [ ] Goal: Replace ad-hoc selector discovery with a deterministic, DOM-only scraper for the purchases page. Do not use `#pagedata` in this task. Keep interfaces and returned data exactly the same; maintain current download behavior for discovered items.

- [x] Canonical selectors and structure:
  - [x] List container: `#oh-container > div.purchases > ol` (ordered list).
  - [x] Item nodes: direct children of the `ol` are `div` elements (e.g., `div.purchases-item`), so target `#oh-container > div.purchases > ol > div` (not `li`).
  - [x] Download link per item: within the item, find anchor with `a[data-tid="download"]` (e.g., under `div.purchases-item-actions`). Do not depend on anchor text.
  - [x] Fallback list selector: if missing, try `#oh-container div.purchases > ol` (less strict). If still missing or zero items, log and throw.
  - [x] Robustness: wait up to 5s for the purchases list (canonical, then fallback) before scraping to avoid premature errors.

- [ ] Summary parsing (optional): may parse `#oh-container > div:nth-child(2) > span` for diagnostics only; do not branch on summary values. Scrape only via DOM regardless of `N/M`.

- [x] Filtering and fields:
  - [x] Return only items that have a direct download anchor (`a[data-tid="download"]`); skip non-downloadable items in DOM mode.
  - [x] Preserve existing item fields and response shape from current implementation; do not add/remove fields and do not change the message format.
  - [x] Normalize download `href` to an absolute URL via `new URL(href, location.origin).href` before returning.

- [x] Error policy and logging:
  - [x] If the canonical list selector does not exist or matches 0 items, log a clear error and throw (no retries). This halts discovery per current error handling.
  - [x] Log key steps: list selector presence and error conditions; keep logs concise.

- [x] Code hygiene and scope constraints:
  - [x] Remove legacy selectors and code paths; do not leave any commented-out code or unused helpers.
  - [x] Only use the selectors specified in this task (canonical + explicit fallback); do not include additional implicit fallbacks or discovery heuristics.
  - [x] Ensure no dead code remains: run a quick scan for unused functions/variables related to the old scraping approach.

- [ ] Out of scope (future tasks):
  - [ ] “View All” expansion and any auto-scroll logic remain separate work; this task does not attempt to expand.
  - [ ] i18n and alternative DOM layouts.

- [x] Acceptance Criteria:
  - [x] AC3.10.1: Scraper does not read or use `#pagedata` under any condition; DOM-only.
  - [x] AC3.10.2: Scraper returns only the visible, downloadable items using the canonical DOM selectors.
  - [x] AC3.10.3: When the canonical list selector is missing or yields 0 items, the scraper logs and throws an error.
  - [x] AC3.10.4: Response shape remains `{ success, purchases, totalCount, message? }` with identical item structure; downstream download behavior remains intact.
  - [x] AC3.10.5: Returned items are only those with `a[data-tid="download"]`, and download URLs are absolute.
  - [x] AC3.10.6: No legacy selectors or commented-out code remain; only the specified selectors are present in the scraper.
  - [x] AC3.10.7: No dead code or unused scraping helpers remain after the refactor.

chrome.downloads.download({
  url: downloadUrl,
  filename: `${artist}/${album}/${trackNumber} - ${title}.mp3`,
  conflictAction: 'overwrite'
});
```

#### Cookies API
```javascript
chrome.cookies.getAll({
  domain: '.bandcamp.com'
}, (cookies) => {
  // Validate session cookies
});
```

### DOM Scraping Strategy
- Use robust CSS selectors for element targeting
- Implement fallback selectors for site changes
- Add retry logic for dynamic content loading
- Use MutationObserver for DOM change detection

### Data Flow Architecture
1. **Authentication Check** → Session validation
2. **Purchase Discovery** → Scrape purchases page
3. **Album Processing** → Extract individual album data
4. **Download Queue** → Sequential download management
5. **File Processing** → Metadata embedding and organization
6. **Progress Reporting** → UI updates and completion tracking

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### DOM Structure Changes
- Implement multiple selector fallbacks
- Use semantic HTML attributes where possible
- Add comprehensive error logging
- Design modular scraping components for easy updates

### Performance Considerations
- Implement download throttling with reasonable delays between downloads
- Use efficient DOM parsing techniques
- Minimize memory usage during large downloads
- Keep progress state in memory only (no cross-session persistence)

### Legal and Ethical Considerations
- Clearly document personal archival use only
- Respect Bandcamp's terms of service
- Implement reasonable rate limiting
- Add user warnings about appropriate use

## Implementation Decisions (Based on User Feedback)

1. **Download Location**: ✅ Custom folder selection - Users can specify their preferred download directory
2. **File Naming Conflicts**: ✅ Make reasonable assumptions (append numbers for duplicates, sanitize special characters) and log decisions in download log
3. **Error Recovery**: ✅ Stop downloads on session expiry and offer user option to resume with new login
4. **Progress Persistence**: ✅ Do the simplest thing - No persistence across browser sessions (session-based only)
5. **Rate Limiting**: ✅ Implement reasonable delays between downloads to respect Bandcamp's servers
6. **Artwork Resolution**: ✅ Use highest resolution artwork available from Bandcamp
7. **Browser Compatibility**: ✅ Chrome-only target (Manifest V3)
8. **Testing Approach**: ✅ Include mock data capabilities for testing without requiring specific test accounts

## ✅ All Requirements Clarified

The implementation plan is now complete with all decisions finalized. Ready to proceed with development following the 7-week roadmap.
